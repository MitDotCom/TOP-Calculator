I finally made it to the last project in this course! I'm excited to begin working on this project.
I'm sure it will take me a while, but I'm sure I'll eventually get it.
I'm going to start with the HTML and CSS just to get the visual part set up first.
I think that might help me visualize the operations I need to make functional.
Here goes nothing!
