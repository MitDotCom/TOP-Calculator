# TOP-Calculator
The Calculator project from The Odin Project

11/19/23 I am going to leave the program in it's currently temporarily complete state- without keyboard functionality, and some decimal point logic to work out.
I messed up by trying to work on the new keyboard functionality in the main branch. And had to do a bunch of reversion and deleting temporary directories to get back to this point.
So I learned my lesson: always make a new branch to work on new features.

I plan to get back to this when I finish the Javascript path in TOP. Before I work on my own larger personal project.

This was a great project where I felt the efficacy of pre-planning the logic and thinking about how I was going to code each of the calculators separate functions.
I think I learned a lot.
