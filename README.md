I finally made it to the last project in this course! I'm excited to begin working on this project.
I'm sure it will take me a while, but I'm sure I'll eventually get it.
I'm going to start with the HTML and CSS just to get the visual part set up first.
I think that might help me visualize the operations I need to make functional.
Here goes nothing!

I'm working on the conditional logic, and I'm learning the importance of understanding the problem and how to solve it before trying to. I think it can be helpful to try and start solving it to understand what problems there are to overcome. But right now I'm first going to work on getting the delete button to work, then all the conditions that depend on which variables are currently stored. And I think that's the main logical method I'm going to use to get the calculator to work.
